# hcmcVscXml
A repository for trying out features to be included in a VSCode extension to support XML encoding.

This repository is not where the extension will be developed; instead, it's a learning playground
to help us get familiar with the concepts and practices required for developing VSCode extensions,
and a place where we can store ideas that we may later be able to implement.
