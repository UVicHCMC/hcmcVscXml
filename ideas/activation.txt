Activation of the extension:

All the projects we envisage using our VSCode extension will have an array of different files including jar files, various schema files, XSLT, and other predictable content. They will also all have a settings.json file for project configuration. But it's probably a good idea to invent an extension-specific file such as myProject.hcmc, which need not contain anything meaningful, to identify the project as requiring the extension to be activated. Then we can activate the extension using the workspaceContains Activation Event:

"activationEvents": [
    "workspaceContains:**/*.hcmc"
]

This is tested and working. However, it's not clear yet whether we can deactivate the extension appropriately. Ideally, it would deactivate when switching to a project folder which does not contain such a file, but there is no deactivationEvents component of the API. There are events such as vscode.workspace.onDidChangeWorkspaceFolders, though, so we can experiment a bit there.
