Considerations for using the built-in terminal:

Most of the actions we need to support through the interface will run at the command line. It is straightforward to open a terminal in VSCode and run a command, and it's also possible to have VSCode inform that command of the context document, so we should be able to do validation and diagnostics quite easily. However, it's not so easy -- maybe not even possible -- to retrieve the results of a terminal operation. One solution to this may be to have most of the output echoed to a report file, which could then be opened at the end of the process. This is what we would do for diagnostics anyway -- spawn Firefox and open the diagnostics page -- but we could so something similar for validation, processing error messages into a text file which we could then open in VSCode itself, or into an HTML page which would open in the web browser.
